***Here, you can take a look at my:***

* university assignments 
* personal work


## Notes:

### Assignment Labels 
University directories are typically labelled in such a way that indicates
what is implemented in the assignment. For example, if I am implementing
a binary heap and a priority queue, then the folder containing that assignment
might be named ***"binHeap_priorityQueue", where the underscore is used to***
***differentiate between subjects.***

Also note that currently the Personal folder only includes source files
extracted from actual personal projects.

### C# and Unity.
