This repo archives code that I've written for university assignments,
projects, and personal use. I'll update this as frequently as possible.

University directories are typically labelled in such a way that indicates
what is implemented in the assignment. For example, if I am implementing
a binary heap and a priority queue, then the folder containing that assignment
might be named "binHeap_priorityQueue", where the underscore is used to
differentiate between subjects.

Also note that currently the Personal folder only includes source files
extracted from actual personal projects.

This repo does not include my work with C# and Unity.

You can find that code here:
